# Packages for Unity Development

My packages for Unity. They're not intended for public consumption but they are available.

### [On Screen Console](https://github.com/PetPumpkin/unity-packages/blob/64671ae313b577c764e1326aed52a00c13534f28/OnScreenConsole.unitypackage)
Simple on screen console, helpful for mobile development when the normal unity debug log isn't available.
